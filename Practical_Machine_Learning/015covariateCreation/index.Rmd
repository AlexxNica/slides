## Two levels of covariate creation

**Level 1: From raw data to covariate**

![covCreation1.png](../../assets/img/08_PredictionAndMachineLearning/covCreation1.png)

**Level 2: Transforming tidy covariates** 

```{r spamData,fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
library(kernlab);data(spam)
spam$capitalAveSq <- spam$capitalAve^2
```



## Level 1, Raw data -> covariates

* Depends heavily on application
* The balancing act is summarization vs. information loss
* Examples:
  * Text files: frequency of words, frequency of phrases ([Google ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams)), frequency of capital letters.
  * Images: Edges, corners, blobs, ridges ([computer vision feature detection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_(computer_vision)))
  * Webpages: Number and type of images, position of elements, colors, videos ([A/B Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing))
  * People: Height, weight, hair color, sex, country of origin. 
* The more knowledge of the system you have the better the job you will do. 
* When in doubt, err on the side of more features
* Can be automated, but use caution!



## Level 2, Tidy covariates -> new covariates

* More necessary for some methods (regression, svms) than for others (classification trees).
* Should be done _only on the training set_
* The best approach is through exploratory analysis (plotting/tables)
* New covariates should be added to data frames




## Load example data


```{r loadData,cache=TRUE}
library(ISLR); library(caret); data(Wage);
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=Wage$wage,
                              p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- Wage[inTrain,]; testing <- Wage[-inTrain,]
```



## Common covariates to add, dummy variables

__Basic idea - convert factor variables to [indicator variables](http://bit.ly/19ZhWB6)__

```{r dummyVar,dependson="loadData"}
table(training$jobclass)
dummies <- dummyVars(wage ~ jobclass,data=training)
head(predict(dummies,newdata=training))
```




## Removing zero covariates

```{r ,dependson="dummyVar"}
nsv <- nearZeroVar(training,saveMetrics=TRUE)
nsv
```




## Spline basis

```{r splines,dependson="dummyVar",cache=TRUE}
library(splines)
bsBasis <- bs(training$age,df=3) 
bsBasis
```

_See also_: ns(),poly()


## Fitting curves with splines

```{r ,dependson="splines",fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
lm1 <- lm(wage ~ bsBasis,data=training)
plot(training$age,training$wage,pch=19,cex=0.5)
points(training$age,predict(lm1,newdata=training),col="red",pch=19,cex=0.5)
```



## Splines on the test set

```{r ,dependson="splines",fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
predict(bsBasis,age=testing$age)
```



## Notes and further reading

* Level 1 feature creation (raw data to covariates)
  * Science is key. Google "feature extraction for [data type]"
  * Err on overcreation of features
  * In some applications (images, voices) automated feature creation is possible/necessary
    * http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~yann/talks/lecun-ranzato-icml2013.pdf
* Level 2 feature creation (covariates to new covariates)
  * The function _preProcess_ in _caret_ will handle some preprocessing.
  * Create new covariates if you think they will improve fit
  * Use exploratory analysis on the training set for creating them
  * Be careful about overfitting!
* [preprocessing with caret](http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/preprocess.html)
* If you want to fit spline models, use the _gam_ method in the _caret_ package which allows smoothing of multiple variables.
* More on feature creation/data tidying in the Obtaining Data course from the Data Science course track.
