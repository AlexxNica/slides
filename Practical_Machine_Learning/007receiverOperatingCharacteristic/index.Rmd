## Why a curve?

* In binary classification you are predicting one of two categories
  * Alive/dead
  * Click on ad/don't click
* But your predictions are often quantitative
  * Probability of being alive
  * Prediction on a scale from 1 to 10
* The _cutoff_  you choose gives different results

## Area under the curve

* AUC = 0.5: random guessing
* AUC = 1: perfect classifer
* In general AUC of above 0.8 considered "good"
